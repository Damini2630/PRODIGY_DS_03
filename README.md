This is a decision tree classifier built to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. ðŸ“Š It utilizes a rich dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Bank Marketing dataset, and aims to uncover insights and develop a predictive model with real-world implications.

From data preprocessing, data visualization and feature engineering to model evaluation and fine-tuning, every step provided me with invaluable experience and a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms.

After rigorous experimentation and meticulous tuning, a decision tree classifier was successfully trained and capable of predicting customer purchasing behavior with impressive accuracy. This accomplishment underscores the power of data-driven insights in informing strategic business decisions and enhancing customer engagement strategies.
